          <h4>Developer - Artist - Photographer - Drone Pilot - Autodidact</h4>
          <p >I have had a life-long obsession with art and design, creating masterpieces from raw materials. When I was handed a crayon in kindergarten, I started drawing, and have never stopped. I created my first website on GeoCities in my early teens. I had my first camera before I was ten. In one form or another, I have always been a creator.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I originally began my professional path in print and design working in print shops where I could learn more about where my designs ended up, and where I could be a craftsman. I designed beautiful promotional material, pop-up books, cardboard displays, and more. I loved it and I worked there several years, but print became tougher and tougher. Digital is king now. I can list off twenty or thirty websites where you can create graphic desing with a few clicks. I was quickly being pushed out of work and good salaries.</p>
          <br />
          <p>I decided it was time to change things up and pursue one of my other passions, photography or software development. I came to the realization that photography was a bit capped on potential nowadays too, and with good reason. I have seen some iPhone and Pixel magicians. They can create the same masterpieces I can with a phone that they already had in their pocket. I still love photography and I carry my DSLR with me on every hike and vacation. It just wasn't suitable for a career.</p>
          <br />
          <p>Which all brought me to where I am now. I spent a few years really pushing my coding skills so that I could create more than simple game addons or websites that were glorified blog posts.I got to a point where I was very comfortable, and then attended a bootcamp to push my skills to new heights, and make this a new long-term career. I work on expanding my skills and knowledge every day. I have created some pretty wonderful projects. I redesigned the back-end for a workspace sharing application, and improved page loads by almost 1000%. I created a video telehealth microservice to integrate into a remote medical monitoring dashboard. I created this site you see from scratch. No Wix or Dreamweaver. I am currently working on a set of digital DM tools for tabletop gaming.</p>
          <br />
          <p style={{ marginBottom: "60px" }}>I know that I've finally found the career that I'll be in until I retire.</p>
